Problem 1:
<p align="center">We would like to make it easier to manage a ready-to-wear store.
The items in the store have: a reference (a code), a description and a unit price excluding tax.
From a quantity of an item purchased at a price excluding tax, we wish to establish invoices for 3 customers
whose names we know. We assume that each of them purchased a single item (quantity = 1).
The invoice will show the customer's name and the amount including tax, knowing that a rate of
15% VAT and the customer benefits from a 2% discount on the amount of these purchases.</p>
